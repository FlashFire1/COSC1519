# Assessment A2 for the class Introduction to Programming at RMIT

## Introduction: 
This is a take-home programming project that you will complete within 48 hours. Such assessments are different from the practical exercises as you are given a problem brief and you will have to devise a solution from a set of precise requirements and written guidance from this assessment description.

## Overview:
Assume that a game developer has hired you for your coding skills to work on an interactive (text-based) adventure game.

### Functional requirements (Game skeleton)
As this is a programming assessment and not a game design one, here is a game skeleton to guide you in the creative part. You need to follow it (scenes +detailed functional requirement) it but, you may add a few extra steps (there is an example of an optional action) and/or change the order of scene/actions.
